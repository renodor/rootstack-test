# Rootstack Developper Test

## General comments
I intentionnally heavily commented all my files and methods in order to explain clearly what I was doing.

## Exercise 1, 2, and 3 (Randomuser)
I decided to do those exercise in Ruby.
Each exercise is in a separate file with the name of the exercise.
I didn't use any front end framework, so to see it working you will have to launch it from the terminal with the command `$ruby file_name.rb`

I did print some informations and all the results so you will see it in the terminal.

## Exercise 4, 5 (Swapi)
I decided to do those exercise in Javascript.
Indeed, it seemed nice to have a basic interface for those exercises so I linked my JS files to very simple HTML in order to gather inputs and display results.

To keep both exercises independent, each one as its own html and js file (with the name of the exercise).
Just launch the HTML file in a browser to see and interact with the programm.
